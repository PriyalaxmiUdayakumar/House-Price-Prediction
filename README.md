HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

Housing price trends are not only the concern of buyers and sellers, but it also indicates the current economic situation. There are many factors which has impact on house prices, such as numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms. Even the nearby location, a location with a great accessibility to highways, expressways, schools, shopping malls and local employment opportunities contributes to the rise in house price. Manual house predication becomes difficult, hence there are many systems developed for house price prediction. House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in the future. 

In the house growth forecasting, will try to find optimal solutions to predict the movement of housing market using historical growth rates or house price indices.

Problems faced during buying a house: 

Buying a house is a stressful thing. Buyers are generally not aware of factors that influence the house prices. Many problems are faced during buying a house. Hence real estate agents are trusted with the communication between buyers and sellers as well as laying down a legal contract for the transfer. This just creates a middle man and increases the cost of houses. 
They believe that it depends upon: 
    The square foot area,The no. of bedrooms 
But it depends upon many factors also, such as: 
    No. of storeys,Area outside the house,Rooms on one floor

Objective:

The goal of this study is through analyzing a real historical transactional dataset to derive valuable insight into the housing market. Effective models could allow home buyers, or real estate agents to make better decisions. Moreover, it could benefit the projection of future house prices and the policymaking process for the real estate market. There are several approaches that can be used to determine the price of the house, one of them is the prediction analysis.

Proposed Algorithm:

House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house.
Algorithms used: Linear Regression and Forest Regression.

Advantages:

Saves time and 
Easy to access the system from anywhere and anytime.

Pre-requisites:

VS code,
Jupyter Notebbok,
Django and
SQLite studio
